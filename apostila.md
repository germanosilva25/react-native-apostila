# Introduction

Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for getting started instructions, they've moved to their own section. Continue reading for an introduction to the documentation, Native Components, React, and more!

Many different kinds of people use React Native: from advanced iOS developers to React beginners, to people getting started programming for the first time in their career. These docs were written for all learners, no matter their experience level or background.

## How to use these docs

You can start here and read through these docs linearly like a book; or you can read the specific sections you need. Already familiar with React? You can skip that section—or read it for a light refresher.

## Prerequisites

To work with React Native, you will need to have an understanding of JavaScript fundamentals. If you’re new to JavaScript or need a refresher, you can dive in or brush up at [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/).

> While we do our best to assume no prior knowledge of React, Android, or iOS development, these are valuable topics of study for the aspiring React Native developer. Where sensible, we have linked to resources and articles that go more in depth.

## Interactive examples

This introduction lets you get started immediately in your browser with interactive examples like this one:

The above is a **Snack Player**. It’s a handy tool created by Expo to embed and run React Native projects and share how they render in platforms like Android and iOS. The code is live and editable, so you can play directly with it in your browser. Go ahead and try changing the `"Try editing me!"` text above to `"Hello, world!"`

> Optionally, if you want to set up a local development environment, you can follow our guide to setting up your environment on your local machine and paste the code examples into your project. (If you are a web developer, you may already have a local environment set up for mobile browser testing!)

## Developer Notes

People from many different development backgrounds are learning React Native. You may have experience with a range of technologies, from web to Android to iOS and more. We try to write for developers from all backgrounds. Sometimes we provide explanations specific to one platform or another like so:

> **Web developers** may be familiar with this concept.

## Formatting

Menu paths are written in **bold** and use carets to navigate submenus. Example:  
**Android Studio > Preferences**

# Core Components and Native Components

React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the app platform’s native capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform’s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let’s cover how components work in React Native.

## Views and mobile development

In Android and iOS development, a **view** is the basic building block of UI: a small rectangular element on the screen which can be used to display text, images, or respond to user input. Even the smallest visual elements of an app, like a line of text or a button, are kinds of views. Some kinds of views can contain other views. It’s views all the way down!

Just a sampling of the many views used in Android and iOS apps.

## Native Components

In Android development, you write views in **Kotlin** or **Java**; in iOS development, you use **Swift** or **Objective-C**. With React Native, you can invoke these views with JavaScript using React components. At runtime, React Native creates the corresponding Android and iOS views for those components. Because React Native components are backed by the same views as Android and iOS, React Native apps look, feel, and perform like any other apps. We call these platform-backed components **Native Components**.

React Native comes with a set of essential, ready-to-use **Native Components** you can use to start building your app today. These are React Native's **Core Components**.

> ⚠️ **Caution**  
> This documentation references a legacy set of APIs and needs to be updated to reflect the New Architecture.

React Native also lets you build your own **Native Components** for Android and iOS to suit your app’s unique needs. We also have a thriving ecosystem of these **community-contributed components**. Check out **[Native Directory](https://reactnative.directory/)** to find what the community has been creating.

## Core Components

React Native has many **Core Components** for everything from controls to activity indicators. You can find them all documented in the **API section**. You will mostly work with the following Core Components:

| React Native UI Component | Android View | iOS View | Web Analog | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `<View>` | `<ViewGroup>` | `<UIView>` | A non-scrolling `<div>` | A container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls |
| `<Text>` | `<TextView>` | `<UITextView>` | `<p>` | Displays, styles, and nests strings of text and even handles touch events |
| `<Image>` | `<ImageView>` | `<UIImageView>` | `<img>` | Displays different types of images |
| `<ScrollView>` | `<ScrollView>` | `<UIScrollView>` | `<div>` | A generic scrolling container that can contain multiple components and views |
| `<TextInput>` | `<EditText>` | `<UITextField>` | `<input type="text">` | Allows the user to enter text |

In the next section, you will start combining these **Core Components** to learn about how React works. Have a play with them here now!

Because React Native uses the same API structure as React components, you’ll need to understand React component APIs to get started. The next section makes for a quick introduction or refresher on the topic. However, if you’re already familiar with React, feel free to skip ahead.
